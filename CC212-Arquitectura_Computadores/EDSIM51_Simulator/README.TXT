On Windows, store edsim51.jar anywhere you wish, then double-clicking on edsim51.jar will launch
the simulator, assuming you have Java installed on your computer.

Information on downloading and installing Java can be found at:

When you exit the simulator for the first time, a file called edsim51Settings.ser will be stored in
the same location as edsim51.jar. For information about this file go to:
