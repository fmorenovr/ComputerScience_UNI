gpsr README
-----------

1) type 'make'
2) assuming it works, you should have a binary called 'gpsr' in the bin directory
3) cd bin;
4) ./gpsr

This will give you very short intro which describes how the program should be run.

Quick start:
------------

To get cracking with a batch of 30 runs of GP on a very well known symbolic regression problem
(quartic polynomial), copy the following into a bash script:

---- begin bash script ----
#!/bin/bash

GP=./bin/gpsr				
RESULTS=/path/to/results/directory	# edit as appropriate
NUMRUNS=30
TRAINFILE=./datasets/quartic_train.dat
TESTFILE=./datasets/quartic_test.dat

for i in `seq -w $NUMRUNS`
do
        $GP -d $TRAINFILE -f $TESTFILE -o $RESULTS/best$i -O $RESULTS/res$i
done
---- end bash script ----

Edit the "results=" line to point to a location where you'd like the results to reside

Make the script executable and launch away..

Use your favourite statistics package to analyse the reults. For now, I'd recommend octave (www.octave.org).

TODO:
----
- a more verbose README
- some statistics code (compare with octave for sanity)
- a suite of datesets
